# Music-with-RNN

## Music Generation with RNNs

In this, we will explore building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for music generation. We will train a model to learn the patterns in raw sheet music in [ABC notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_notation) and then use this model to generate new music.
